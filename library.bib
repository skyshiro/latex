abstract = { This paper presents analytic and experimental comparisons for high-efficiency class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers. The analytic formula of the efficiencies, output powers, dc power dissipations, and fundamental load impedances of both amplifiers are derived from the ideal current and voltage waveforms. Based on the formula, the performances are compared with a reasonable condition: fundamental output power levels of class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers are conditioned to be identical. The results show that the inverse class-F amplifier has better efficiency than that of class-F amplifiers as the on-resistance of the transistor increases. For experimental comparison, we have designed and implemented the class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers at I-GHz band using a GaAs MESFET and analyzed the measured performances. Experimental results shows 10{\%} higher power-added efficiency of the inverse class-F amplifier than that of the class-F amplifier, which verifies the waveform analysis.},
