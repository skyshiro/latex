abstract = {Power-amplifier class-F operation is investigated and revised, evidencing the fundamental importance of the harmonic-generating mechanism and the limitations im- posed by the device input and output nonlinearities on the ideal class-F behavior. Closed- form expressions are derived for the major design quantities, together with the optimum fundamental and third-harmonic loading of the active device. A design procedure, making use of the derived expressions, is presented and the deviations from the ideal behavior are discussed. Sample designs, making use of a full nonlinear device model and commercial analysis software, are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis and the design procedure. It is shown, both analytically and using commercial nonlinear simula- tions, that blind application of commonly used, idealized class-F harmonic terminations can cause unexpected detrimental results.},

abstract = {A saturated power amplifier (PA) optimized for efficiency is described. As a PA is driven into saturated operation, the current source of the device generates a large third harmonic current, which creates a quasi-rectangular current waveform. The large nonlinear output capacitor of the transistor generates a second harmonic voltage with a very small third harmonic component. The second harmonic voltage is in-phase with the fundamental voltage, making a half-sine wave voltage waveform with voltage peaking. These waveforms are similar to those of a class {\textless}formula formulatype="inline"{\textgreater}{\textless}tex Notation="TeX"{\textgreater}{\$}{\{}\backslashhbox{\{}F{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}{\{}-{\}}1{\}}{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater} {\textless}/formula{\textgreater}.

However, the required harmonic impedances are just larger than the impedance levels of the output capacitance for both the second and third harmonics. Therefore, the circuit topology is similar to that of a class E amplifier, which is very simple. The PA implemented using a GaN HEMT delivers the expected good performance using the simple circuit topology.},

abstract = {This paper presents a harmonic termination technique for single- and multi-band high-efficiency class-F monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) power amplifiers (PAs). The harmonic termination network (HTN), realized with the minimum possible number of elements, can be used to terminate an arbitrary number of harmonics in a single-band PA or harmonics of multiple frequencies in a concurrent multi-band PA. The drain and gate bias lines are embedded in the HTNs to obviate the need for RF chokes and reduce the chip area. A single- and a dual-band MMIC PA are designed using the proposed technique and implemented in a 0.25- $\mu$m AlGaAs-InGaAs pHEMT technology. The single-band 5.5-GHz PA provides 27.5 dBm of output power with 70{\%} power-added efficiency (PAE). This PAE level is achieved by terminating the first five harmonics at the output as well as the first three harmonics at the input of PA. The dual-band PA, operating at 5 and 12 GHz, delivers the output power of 28.0 and 26.7 dBm with PAE of 58{\%} and 51{\%}, at the two frequency bands, respectively.},

abstract = {Class-F power amplifiers (PA's) employ harmonic-frequency resonators to shape their drain or collector waveforms to improve efficiency. Generally, the output network must present the drain with either an open or short circuit at the harmonic frequencies. At VHF and higher frequencies, the drain capacitance, lead inductance, lead length, and dispersion make implementation of reasonably ideal tuned circuits difficult. However it is possible to control the impedances at a finite number of harmonics. This note first derives the basic relationships among the Fourier coefficients of the waveforms and the performance of the amplifier. Fourier coefficients for maximally flat waveforms are then derived for inclusion of up to the fifth harmonic. Amplifier performance is then tabulated as a function of which harmonics are included in the voltage and current waveforms. Efficiency increases from 50{\%} of class A toward 100{\%} as harmonics are added. Power-output capability increases by up to 27{\%}},

abstract = {The generation of RF/microwave power is required not only in$\backslash$nwireless communications, but also in applications such as jamming,$\backslash$nimaging, RF heating, and miniature dc/dc converters. Each application$\backslash$nhas its own unique requirements for frequency, bandwidth, load, power,$\backslash$nefficiency, linearity, and cost. RF power is generated by a wide variety$\backslash$nof techniques, implementations, and active devices. Power amplifiers are$\backslash$nincorporated into transmitters in a similarly wide variety of$\backslash$narchitectures, including linear, Kalm, envelope tracking, outphasing,$\backslash$nand Doherty. Linearity can be improved through techniques such as$\backslash$nfeedback, feedforward, and predistortion},

@article{Sokal1975,
abstract = {The new class of amplifiers described is based on a load network synthesized to have a transient response which maximizes power efficiency even if the active device switching times are substantial fractions of the a.c. cycle. The new class of amplifiers, named `Class E,' is defined and is illustrated by a detailed description and a set of design equations for one simple member of the class. For that circuit the authors measured 96 percent transistor efficiency at 3.9 MHz at 26-W output from a pair of Motorola 2N3735 TO-5 transistors. Advantages of Class E are unusually high efficiency, a priori designability, large reduction in second-breakdown stress, low sensitivity to active-device characteristics, and potential for high-efficiency operation at higher frequencies than previously published Class-D circuits.},

@article{Tsang2010,
abstract = {Advanced Design System (ADS) from Agilent is used for design and simulation based on the ADS model of Cree's CGH40010 high electron mobility transistor (HEMT). A high efficiency power amplifier is fabricated on RT/duroid 5870 high frequency laminate board. In this design, the harmonics at the input are controlled as well as the harmonics at the output. An input wave-shaping network is designed to shape the waveforms at the gate. In this case, the PAE is boosted 30{\%} higher than the PA with only the output wave- shaping network. By terminating harmonics with proper impedances at the output, a square voltage waveform and a half-sine current waveform are obtained at the transistor drain terminal. The overlapping area between the voltage and current waveforms can be reduced as well as the active device power consumption. The final design operating at 1GHz produced a PAE of 89{\%} with 38.35dBm output power in simulation and PAE of 78{\%} with 38.7dBm output power as the result of the IEEE PA design contest.

@article{Woo2006,
abstract = { This paper presents analytic and experimental comparisons for high-efficiency class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers. The analytic formula of the efficiencies, output powers, dc power dissipations, and fundamental load impedances of both amplifiers are derived from the ideal current and voltage waveforms. Based on the formula, the performances are compared with a reasonable condition: fundamental output power levels of class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers are conditioned to be identical. The results show that the inverse class-F amplifier has better efficiency than that of class-F amplifiers as the on-resistance of the transistor increases. For experimental comparison, we have designed and implemented the class-F and inverse class-F amplifiers at I-GHz band using a GaAs MESFET and analyzed the measured performances. Experimental results shows 10{\%} higher power-added efficiency of the inverse class-F amplifier than that of the class-F amplifier, which verifies the waveform analysis.},
